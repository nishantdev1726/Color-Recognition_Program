# Color-Recognition_Program
Color recognition machine learning program with OpenCV and Python.

Here We've created Pentone Color Dataset which includes Colors name, their Hex-codes and RGB Values.

To run the program, use following commands:

  --> python color_detection.py -i your_image.jpg    (Replace your_image.jpg with image which you want to use for detection.)
